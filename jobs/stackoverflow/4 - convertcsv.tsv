We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.</p><br /><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of some projects we&rsquo;ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login</li><br /><li>Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)</li><br /><li>Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What we want from you: (aka: skills)</strong></p><br /><p>We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.</p><br /><p><strong>Relationship Details:</strong></p><br /><p>We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.</p><br /><p>We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don&rsquo;t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren&rsquo;t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.&nbsp;</p>"	Tue, 03 Mar 2020 01:27:14 Z	2020-03-03T01:27:14Z

Working closely with marketing and data science stakeholders, the Growth pod is focused on establishing Quizlet as the leading destination for online learning tools and innovating ways for learners worldwide to better find the study material within Quizlet that will unlock their success.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Activation </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The mission on the Activation team is to ""Make the first experiences people have with Quizlet Magical -- with the right content, tools, and knowledge right away"". They are currently trying to accomplish that mission by connecting new learners with content and encouraging them to sign up so we can provide personalization and better studying experiences when they come back.</p><br /><p><strong>Re-engagement </strong><em>Denver</em></p><br /><p>The team's goal is to re-engage Quizlet users with compelling reasons to return and continue their learning journey. And the team wants to personalize the learning journey for every Quizlet learner and to make learning more fun. Engineers in this team would also like to harness the power of the community to make studying better.</p><br /><p><strong>Ads and Partners </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The Ads and Partners team has two objectives. The Ads objective is to achieve the highest ads revenue while maintaining or enhancing user experience. This is achieved by moving towards higher-value quality ads product, launching innovative offerings of Ad products in EdTech, and creating a unique inventory for Quizlet. The Partners' objective is to help top tier educational publishers provide their students with integrated digital study tools so we can engineer a holistic experience for the learners.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Agora </strong><em>Denver</em></p><br /><p>Team Agora builds the Premium marketplace which helps people that are studying for high stakes exams. Imagine you're taking the Bar Exam, studying to get your CPA or the Series 7 in finance. If you get it right, it's career-altering. The team brings content from trusted vendors like Kaplan, Pearson and Elsevier to help studiers. The effort just got going, and it's a bit like a startup within a startup.</p><br /><p><strong>Pod Infrastructure </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The mission of the Pod Infrastructure team (also known as team Octo) is to power larger,&nbsp;user-facing functionality that helps scale the company. This means cleaning up old code, migrating to new APIs, and fixing underlying issues that empower the Pods to build features more easily and at scale. When possible, team Octo will pull functionality out of Quizlet and into new services. They help all parts of the organization including Pods, People Ops, Marketing, User Ops, and Engineering.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Subscriptions- Innovation </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The team's mission is to deliver excellence to our subscribers through premium features that target their needs to succeed. Some of the features we&rsquo;ve built are: OCR to efficiently create content from a picture of printed materials, offline access, rich text to make key points more memorable, and customized Quizlet Live for our teachers.</p><br /><p><strong>Subscriptions - Growth </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The team takes pride in keeping Quizlet free for anyone to use. Free access is made possible by our growing base of power users (both students and teachers) who pay to subscribe to our premium features. Our focus is to improve our renewals, creating compelling upsell experiences, explore new payment options, offer different plans that meet users&rsquo; need as Quizlet grow internationally.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;<strong>Study </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The Study team strives to help learners meet their study goals across all of our supported platforms. This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to study and master the content in Quizlet and looking for ways to improve our study modes like ML adaptive Learn mode. One of the current projects is modernizing the Study modes to a shared core logic in Kotlin, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.</p><br /><p><strong>Discover </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>Team Discover is one of Quizlet&rsquo;s product engineering teams focused on user engagement and improving core product features. This includes researching better ways to create, find, and organize content. One of the team&rsquo;s current projects is providing behavioral-based recommendations to users that help them discover new study content that they&rsquo;ll be interested in.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Web Infrastructure </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The Web Infrastructure team is focused on app performance and developer productivity. A key initiative is wiring GraphQL into our APIs and through our React + Redux client. They enable safe deploys with strong type checking (Flow + TypeScript), comprehensive test coverage (Jest) and full integration testing (Cypress).</p><br /><p><strong>Content Services </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>Quizlet manages many kinds of content, and more of it every moment, to fulfill our mission of helping people around the world learn. The Content Services team identifies the parts of our system that are bumping up against the most intransigent data-scalability challenges and builds solutions that give us the breathing room to continue scaling those areas by at least tenfold. This typically involves migrating data from MySQL to other database systems, such as Google Cloud Spanner. It also involves innovating in the way we structure our applications: moving toward a service-oriented architecture that allows us to choose the right tools for each job, manage and scale services independently, and make our system more resilient. Nowadays this work features Kotlin, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, and it requires keeping up to date on the technology landscape for global-scale persistent data stores.</p>"	Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:55:46 Z	2020-03-12T07:55:46Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	Denver, CO

This role is from-the-ground-up building a new front-end, so you need to be comfortable with the slight chaos that comes with that. Once we're further along and closer to launch, testing maturity processes will be added.

Our focus is to improve our renewals, creating compelling upsell experiences, explore new payment options, offer different plans that meet users&rsquo; need as Quizlet grow internationally.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p>&nbsp;<strong>Study </strong><em><span>SF</span></em></p><br /><p><span>The Study team strives to help learners meet their study goals across all of our supported platforms. This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to study and master the content in Quizlet and looking for ways to improve our study modes like ML adaptive Learn mode. One of the current projects is modernizing the Study modes to a shared core logic in Kotlin, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.</span></p><br /><p><strong>Discover </strong><em><span>SF</span></em></p><br /><p><span>Team Discover is one of Quizlet&rsquo;s product engineering teams focused on user engagement and improving core product features. This includes researching better ways to create, find, and organize content. One of the team&rsquo;s current projects is providing behavioral-based recommendations to users that help them discover new study content that they&rsquo;ll be interested in.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p><strong>Web Infrastructure </strong><em><span>SF</span></em></p><br /><p><span>The Web Infrastructure team is focused on app performance and developer productivity. A key initiative is wiring GraphQL into our APIs and through our React + Redux client. They enable safe deploys with strong type checking (Flow + TypeScript), comprehensive test coverage (Jest) and full integration testing (Cypress).</span></p><br /><p><strong>Content Services </strong><em><span>SF</span></em></p><br /><p><span>Quizlet manages many kinds of content, and more of it every moment, to fulfill our mission of helping people around the world learn. The Content Services team identifies the parts of our system that are bumping up against the most intransigent data-scalability challenges and builds solutions that give us the breathing room to continue scaling those areas by at least tenfold. This typically involves migrating data from MySQL to other database systems, such as Google Cloud Spanner. It also involves innovating in the way we structure our applications: moving toward a service-oriented architecture that allows us to choose the right tools for each job, manage and scale services independently, and make our system more resilient. Nowadays this work features Kotlin, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, and it requires keeping up to date on the technology landscape for global-scale persistent data stores.</span></p>"	Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:54:33 Z	2020-03-12T07:54:33Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	San Francisco, CA

Working closely with marketing and data science stakeholders, the Growth pod is focused on establishing Quizlet as the leading destination for online learning tools and innovating ways for learners worldwide to better find the study material within Quizlet that will unlock their success.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Activation&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The mission on the Activation team is to ""Make the first experiences people have with Quizlet Magical -- with the right content, tools, and knowledge right away"". They are currently trying to accomplish that mission by connecting new learners with content and encouraging them to sign up so we can provide personalization and better studying experiences when they come back.</p><br /><p><strong>Re-engagement&nbsp;</strong><em>Denver</em></p><br /><p>The team's goal is to re-engage Quizlet users with compelling reasons to return and continue their learning journey. And the team wants to personalize the learning journey for every Quizlet learner and to make learning more fun. Engineers in this team would also like to harness the power of the community to make studying better.</p><br /><p><strong>Ads and Partners&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The Ads and Partners team has two objectives. The Ads objective is to achieve the highest ads revenue while maintaining or enhancing user experience. This is achieved by moving towards higher-value quality ads product, launching innovative offerings of Ad products in EdTech, and creating a unique inventory for Quizlet. The Partners' objective is to help top tier educational publishers provide their students with integrated digital study tools so we can engineer a holistic experience for the learners.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Agora&nbsp;</strong><em>Denver</em></p><br /><p>Team Agora builds the Premium marketplace which helps people that are studying for high stakes exams.

This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to study and master the content in Quizlet and looking for ways to improve our study modes like ML adaptive Learn mode. One of the current projects is modernizing the Study modes to a shared core logic in Kotlin, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.</p><br /><p><strong>Discover&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>Team Discover is one of Quizlet&rsquo;s product engineering teams focused on user engagement and improving core product features. This includes researching better ways to create, find, and organize content. One of the team&rsquo;s current projects is providing behavioral-based recommendations to users that help them discover new study content that they&rsquo;ll be interested in.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Web Infrastructure&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The Web Infrastructure team is focused on app performance and developer productivity. A key initiative is wiring GraphQL into our APIs and through our React + Redux client. They enable safe deploys with strong type checking (Flow + TypeScript), comprehensive test coverage (Jest) and full integration testing (Cypress).</p><br /><p><strong>Content Services&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>Quizlet manages many kinds of content, and more of it every moment, to fulfill our mission of helping people around the world learn. The Content Services team identifies the parts of our system that are bumping up against the most intransigent data-scalability challenges and builds solutions that give us the breathing room to continue scaling those areas by at least tenfold. This typically involves migrating data from MySQL to other database systems, such as Google Cloud Spanner. It also involves innovating in the way we structure our applications: moving toward a service-oriented architecture that allows us to choose the right tools for each job, manage and scale services independently, and make our system more resilient. Nowadays this work features Kotlin, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, and it requires keeping up to date on the technology landscape for global-scale persistent data stores.</p>"	Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:06:38 Z	2020-03-12T08:06:38Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	Denver, CO

We use messaging channels like Facebook Messenger and SMS to improve the shopping experience for Shopify merchants and their customers. We work closely with Shopify, Klaviyo, Yotpo, and other top tech platforms in the ecommerce space. We are pioneering the future of ecommerce through conversational commerce. We are an all-remote company and venture backed, some of our investors include General Catalyst, Boost VC, and M Ventures.<br><br>You will work directly with our CTO Leif K-Brooks (founder and creator of Omegle, the largest chat platform of its kind, used by millions daily), our Director of Engineering, and our product team, to help build Octane AI's back-end technology and front-end experience. You will be in charge of building and implementing new plugins and features. You will be a critical member of the team, impacting our customers and revenue with the features you develop.<br><br><strong>More about working in Engineering at Octane AI</strong><br><br><br />- We believe the happier you are, the more productive you and the team are. Being a remote company allows us to work from wherever we'd prefer. Spend your evenings and weekends with your family/friends/hobbies.<br />- We hate bureaucracy. Feel free to talk to anyone in the team.&nbsp;<br />- Your ideas are welcome. If you know how to improve our codebase, our product, our processes, don't be shy to share it.<br />- In our weekly meetings we do a fun thing called ""fast parrot"". Everybody, including the CEO, is involved. It's a little weird and fun at the same time, especially if you are doing a meeting from a public place.<br />- Our release process involves code review. In rare cases, we deploy without it, but we try hard to make sure at least one more pair of eyes looks at the code.<br />- Flexible working hours. We have only two meetings a week (they're back-to-back) where the whole team participates and it's necessary to be online. For the rest of the time, it's up to you to choose the most productive schedule for your work.&nbsp;<br />- Three days a month we have ""maintenance days"" where you choose what to work on. Usually we work on tech debt, i.e. code cleanup or purely tech improvements.<br />- Don't work if you are sick. It's way better to rest and recover quicker than work at half power for a long time.<br />- If you feel you are stuck with a task don't hesitate to ask for help. There are no stupid questions, nobody expects you to know everything.<br><br><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><ul><br /><li>Work with the product team and engineering teammates to develop and implement new features and plugins for Octane AI. A well-rounded &amp; diversified engineer is ideal for this role. If you love working with frontend mostly, that's also fine as long as you are able to change backend whenever needed.</li><br /><li>Transform our roadmap and your ideas into scalable products and features. You will have the power to guide the direction of the company and the (many) features we build.</li><br /><li>Implement new integrations within Octane AI. You will be working with the Facebook API and the APIs of products and services that we will be integrating into our bots and the Octane AI platform.

You like to focus on the abstract inner workings of a platform and data.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><p>We help resolve serious problems in credit, where there are impacts on all kinds of businesses and consumers. It&rsquo;s serious business and European banks alone generate over 150 billion Euros per year in new problem cases.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>But it&rsquo;s not just the business opportunity that is large. It&rsquo;s a tech challenge. Everything we deal with is asynchronous. There can be milliseconds or weeks in between reactions or events. This comes with a set of technical challenges that go above and beyond the run of the mill app. There are multiple stakeholders, inputs, and third parties. As a team, we built a fully enterprise-ready solution in the course of a few months, one capable of scaling almost infinitely. Our architecture is unique and provides real flexibility for implementing new features.</p><br /><p>Our people want to win and push themselves to become the best in their field. They combine a never-ending curiosity, a desire to make things happen, work openly and closely with colleagues across the business, and evolve to become comfortable with making their own decisions and taking responsibility for services that make up the entire system.</p><br /><p>They put in the thought on complex issues, talk within the team about the tradeoffs of various solutions, welcome feedback, and implement quality directly into the code. This includes comfort with various abstractions and patterns, as well as creating the tests necessary to ensure that the code works properly. When there is technical debt created, they document it for later, or while building something new, refactor the services to make them better as they go.</p><br /><p>If you think a great day starts with a challenge to solve, want to have a real impact in one of Europe&rsquo;s Fintech companies, and be part of a diverse team, then send us a CV and do include some information that&rsquo;s helpful to round out the bullet points in a CV. This could be a short blurb why you&rsquo;re interested, a link to code or projects you&rsquo;ve done in the past. Anything that helps us understand you.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p><strong>What we&rsquo;re looking for:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Enthusiasm for working in a high-profile startup culture. We ship updates quickly, on tight schedules, with large volumes being processed</li><br /><li>Polyglots welcome: We use Typescript for most everything, but experience with typical back-end programming languages and no fear of typing is fine</li><br /><li>Experience with different frameworks</li><br /><li>Experience with API design (Swagger, Contracts, etc)</li><br /><li>Understanding of infrastructure as code</li><br /><li>Understanding of networking (VPN, Subnets, etc)</li><br /><li>Experience with third-party API&rsquo;s</li><br /><li>Solid understanding of testing, continuous integration and deployment</li><br /><li>Experience in Agile software development: Git, Jira, etc.</li><br /><li>Experience in cloud-based ecosystems like AWS&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><br /><p><strong><br>Benefits:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Join one of Europe&rsquo;s top startups</li><br /><li>Work in the architecture everyone talks about, but doesn&rsquo;t implement</li><br /><li>Work in the heart of Hamburg in a very international team</li><br /><li>A flat hierarchy, where you will have direct access to the founders</li><br /><li>A high degree of learning and ownership in a dynamic environment</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p>This job is located in Hamburg, Germany.</p>	Mon, 16 Mar 2020 15:34:51 Z	2020-03-16T15:34:51Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	Hamburg, Germany

We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><br /><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><br /><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><br /><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><a href=""https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match"" rel=""nofollow"">https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><br /><li><a href=""https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast"" rel=""nofollow"">https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><br /><li><a href=""https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge"" rel=""nofollow"">https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li><br /></ul><br /><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href=""https://withkoji.com/create"" rel=""nofollow"">https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><br /><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click ""Remix"" on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href=""https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3"" rel=""nofollow"">this game</a> into <a href=""https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando"" rel=""nofollow"">this game</a>).</p><br /><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><br /><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href=""https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)"" rel=""nofollow"">scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><br /><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the ""<a href=""https://withkoji.com/create"" rel=""nofollow"">/create</a>"" page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><br /><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><br /><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><br /><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><br /><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><br /><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Join our <a href=""https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6"" rel=""nofollow"">Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><br /><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><br /><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><br /><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>"	Thu, 19 Mar 2020 20:18:32 Z	2020-03-19T20:18:32Z

You'll have the opportunity to work in Product Development teams in different domains, both in new greenfield products as well as evolving existing ones.</p><br /><p>Why are we looking for polyglot developers? Well, we know everyone has their favourite language or framework, but we also know that it&rsquo;s important to use the right tool/language/framework for the job at hand, and that a pragmatic approach might mean using a language that is already in production. Also, polyglot developers tend to focus on core software engineering principles and practices, rather than what is shiny in a new framework or language. So whilst we have a preference to work with JavaScript it doesn&rsquo;t mean we aren&rsquo;t able to lend our skills and work with other languages when it makes sense.</p><br /><p>Through regular Learning Lunches, Technical Brown Bags, Software Crafters Meetups, Team Offsites and other team get-togethers the team at Pragmateam learn and collaborate together and are always sharing knowledge and helping each other, both within Pragmateam and in the community.</p><br /><p>To be successful in this role you have an open mind to the kind of development language that you use on the job and most likely consider yourself a polyglot, ie. someone who is keen to work with the right software solution and is happy to learn new languages or further develop their skills if needed for the task at hand...you&rsquo;ll also love developing the skills of other software engineers and helping them improve their craft and capability.

Our team has come together from a diverse set of academic and professional backgrounds: software development, computer science, mathematics, physics, and metallurgy. Our goal is to leverage this expertise through trust and cooperation. We want to foster an environment where team members have frequent opportunities to learn from each other in fields that they are not (yet) experts.</p><br /><p>The machine learning and data science we employ comes in several varieties: image processing, signal processing, classical supervised modeling, unsupervised methods, exploratory data analysis, and fundamental statistics and probability. As a frontend software engineer, your specific expertise as well as your motivation would be the major factors in determining your day-to-day work.</p><br /><p>We are grateful to stand on the shoulders of the open source giants. We use NumPy-flavored Python3 as the basis for our development, taking advantage of the availability of libraries designed for both software engineering and data science, ranging from Flask to SciPy, SQLAlchemy to Keras, Jupyter to Pandas, and many more. When Python&rsquo;s time or space complexity becomes a constraint, we turn to modern C++. When we require client-side browser-based interactivity, we turn to JavaScript.</p><br /><p><strong>HOW WE DEFINE THE FRONTEND</strong></p><br /><p>Currently, we use Python&rsquo;s Flask with Jinja templating to deliver visualizations and interfaces powered by HighCharts, Bootstrap and jQuery. This means that, for us, the frontend starts with Python and ends with whatever is possible in the user&rsquo;s browser. We do not aim to build single page applications or dashboards, rather interfaces whose usability for process engineers is competitive with the desktop applications that have been battle tested for decades.</p><br /><p>The ideal frontend that we work towards is not isolated from the rest of the development team, but instead utilized to more effectively bring a cohesive product to our customers. In order to meet this goal, it is our impression that the proper abstraction layer does not exist between Python and JavaScript, rather within JavaScript itself. The role of the frontend software engineer is then to develop and maintain a JavaScript API that abstracts complexity away from teammates that are focused on other components of the product, while also developing and solidifying the frontend&rsquo;s role in the greater product stack.</p><br /><p><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Collaboratively develop, design, and deploy interactive, dynamic UX solutions</li><br /><li>Leverage your own experience and expertise to guide the shape of the frontend</li><br /><li>Work alongside machine learning engineers to optimize visualizations and product experience</li><br /><li>Define, develop and maintain the role of the frontend within the product technology stack</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS THAT CATCH OUR EYE</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>A significant technical background with a transition to a design-oriented role, or a significant design-oriented background with a transition to a technical role</li><br /><li>Experience creating responsive layouts that adhere to principles of usability, compatibility and accessibility</li><br /><li>Experience developing browser-based visualizations of time series or other industrial data</li><br /><li>Experience working alongside and within a Python server framework, especially Flask</li><br /><li>Fluency in German or Russian is a plus; English is required</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Transparency of business strategies</li><br /><li>Autonomy balanced by responsibility</li><br /><li>Cohesive, multidisciplinary team</li><br /><li>Meaningful industrial problems</li><br /><li>Modern machine learning techniques</li><br /><li>Sleek, new office located in Berlin</li><br /><li>Professional educational opportunities</li><br /><li>German language courses and public transport included</li><br /><li>Free drinks and fruits</li><br /></ul>	Mon, 09 Mar 2020 08:27:06 Z	2020-03-09T08:27:06Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	Berlin, Germany

() (allows remote)	"<p><strong>Location:&nbsp;</strong>Remote</p><br /><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><br /><p>The Wikipedia Library Team at Wikimedia Foundation is looking for a Software Engineer to work with us to add features and capabilities to the Wikipedia Library project as part of a new team.</p><br /><p>The Wikipedia Library project allows approved users to freely access paywalled research databases to use as reference and background when editing articles on Wikipedia. The tool is primarily written in Django with several other Python libraries included.</p><br /><p>The Community Programs team has envisioned and built the current version of the Wikipedia Library. We are seeking a Software Engineer to help maintain and expand the tool as part of a strategy to grow the tool&rsquo;s usage and capabilities. This work will not, at first, directly interface with MediaWiki PHP code but will use Wikipedia APIs to enable some features including authentication and access. Working directly with MediaWiki PHP might be part of the team&rsquo;s responsibilities in the future.</p><br /><br /><p>This is an ideal opportunity for a developer interested in working towards the Wikimedia Foundation mission who is primarily a Python developer. The application is in production so you&rsquo;ll need an interest to understand the existing system. You&rsquo;ll also be working with a Product Manager to identify, plan, and deliver new features. The team will start small with two engineers but could grow and take on even more projects.</p><br /><br /><p>We use open source tools as much as possible, and always open source our own work (<a href=""https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/TWLight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/TWLight</a>). Python and Javascript make up most of our code, but we value using the right tool for the job. Developers at the Foundation have autonomy and responsibility, and can have a large and immediate impact on the future of the mission and the movement. Our world is vast and can be complicated, so we value communication, enthusiasm, and eagerness to learn as much as certificates or degrees.</p><br /><br /><p>This role is fully remote or located in our office in San Francisco, CA. Most of the leadership team on this project is remote.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Architect, develop, test, and deploy new features, improvements and upgrades to the Wikipedia Library used by the Wikimedia community</li><br /><li>Partner with Foundation staff and volunteers on software design, development, testing and evaluation of potential technical solutions</li><br /><li>Help identify and implement best practices in engineering processes across the team</li><br /><li>Ensure positive and constructive discussions with the community and the Foundation</li><br /><li>Work and communicate effectively within a small team distributed across multiple time zones</li><br /><li>Work with the team&rsquo;s Product Manager to scope and plan the technical work</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Education and/or experience with Object-Oriented development using Python and Javascript</li><br /><li>Front-end web application development skills</li><br /><li>Experience with collaborative open source communities</li><br /><li>Openness to working with a diverse and geographically distributed team</li><br /><li>Strong written communication skills as our collaboration largely happens online</li><br /><li>Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in CS or related field or the equivalent in work related experience</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p><strong>Nice to Haves</strong></p><br /><p><em>In addition to the basic skills needed for being successful, these skills could set you apart from the pack!</em></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience with MediaWiki development or or as a contributor to Wikimedia projects</li><br /><li>Experience with object-oriented PHP development</li><br /><li>Experience with Test-Driven Development and agile methodologies</li><br /><li>Any other free/open source software development experience is highly welcome</li><br /><li>Understanding of the free culture movement</li><br /><li>Experience with machine learning or AI technologies</li><br /><li>Experience with online community moderation or anti-harassment tools</li><br /><li>Experience with integrating web products with commonly implemented library services, such as discovery, resource usage analytics, and EZProxy</li><br /><li>Experience with integrating web products with commonly implemented in library standards and protocols, such as Z39.50, Z39.88, OAI, and COUNTER</li><br /><li>Experience normalizing heterogeneous data sets and developing ETL tools</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p><strong>Show us your stuff!</strong></p><br /><p><em>If you have any existing open source software that you've developed (these could be your own software or patches to other packages), please share the URLs for the source. Links to GitHub, etc. are exceptionally useful. This is optional and your candidacy will not be negatively impacted if you don&rsquo;t have public work to share.</em></p><br /><br /><p><strong>About the Wikimedia Foundation</strong></p><br /><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is the non-profit organization that supports and hosts Wikipedia and several other Wikimedia free knowledge sites. Every month, the Wikimedia sites are accessed by more than a billion unique devices. Wikipedia consists of more than 40 million articles across hundreds of languages. Every month, more than 70,000 volunteer editors contribute to Wikipedia. Based in San Francisco, California, the Wikimedia Foundation is an audited, 501(c)(3) non-profit that is funded primarily through donations and grants. It currently employs over 340 staff members.</p><br /><br /><p>At the Foundation, we build technology to help people everywhere access free knowledge, across all devices and in over 300 languages. We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore our wikis. We create programs and initiatives to make knowledge freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build new tools for the community of editors so their wiki can continue to improve and grow. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that make the site possible, including through&nbsp;<a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Start"" rel=""nofollow"">grantmaking programs</a>&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><br /><br /><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>U.S. Benefits &amp; Perks*</em></strong></p><br /><br /><ul><br /><li><em>Fully paid medical, dental and vision coverage for employees and their eligible families (yes, fully paid premiums!)</em></li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>The Wellness Program provides reimbursement for mind, body and soul activities such as fitness memberships, baby sitting, continuing education and much more</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>The 401(k) retirement plan offers matched contributions at 4% of annual salary</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>Flexible and generous time off - vacation, sick and volunteer days, plus 19 paid holidays - including the last week of the year.</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>Family friendly! 100% paid new parent leave for seven weeks plus an additional five weeks for pregnancy, flexible options to phase back in after leave, fully equipped lactation room.</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>For those emergency moments - long and short term disability, life insurance (2x salary) and an employee assistance program</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>Pre-tax savings plans for health care, child care, elder care, public transportation and parking expenses</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>Telecommuting and flexible work schedules available</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>Appropriate fuel for thinking and coding (aka, a pantry full of treats) and monthly massages to help staff relax</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>Great colleagues - diverse staff and contractors speaking dozens of languages from around the world, fantastic intellectual discourse, mission-driven and intensely passionate people</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p><strong><em>*Eligible international workers' benefits are specific to their location and dependent on their employer of record</em></strong></p>"	Mon, 16 Mar 2020 18:38:04 Z	2020-03-16T18:38:04Z

We review the other team&rsquo;s infrastructure code to make sure it&rsquo;s in line with where we want to go.&nbsp; And we work to build better tooling around development processes to support the other teams in their work to push the product forward.</p><br /><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><br /><p>As a DevOps focused engineer, your typical day-to-day involves:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Evaluating, testing and building new infrastructure tools and technology</li><br /><li>Writing detailed planning documents on stories so your teammates can assess the proposed approaches to a story, offer suggestions of approaches missed, and we can all agree on where to go from there</li><br /><li>Writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying)</li><br /><li>Carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) to the highest of standards</li><br /><li>Helping the full stack development teams write infrastructure code, and reviewing said code</li><br /><li>Writing clear documentation around infrastructure code and development tooling so that it&rsquo;s easy to understand, use, and modify</li><br /><li>Working closely with the rest of the team to deploy new releases and data migrations without hiccups&nbsp;</li><br /><li>And finally, ensuring the availability of the Ceros platform</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What we&rsquo;re looking for:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience with CI/CD pipelines, configuration management, infrastructure orchestration, containerization, linux administration... you know, DevOps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><br /><ul><br /><li>In particular, several years of experience with Terraform and Kubernetes.&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><li>An eagerness to write well documented, clear code.&nbsp; You understand that infrastructure code is still code and the principles of documentation and organization that apply to every other kind of code, still apply here.</li><br /><li>The wisdom of experience.&nbsp; You understand that principles and design patterns are important guidelines, but not hard and fast rules.&nbsp; You know when to apply a pattern and when not to, when to hold fast to a certain principle, and when to let it go.&nbsp; You understand that sometimes we can&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good and we&rsquo;ll have to take on tech debt, but when we do, it should be with consideration and intention (and should be documented).</li><br /><li>An eagerness to learn.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re looking for engineers who are able and eager to keep up with the pace of our rapidly evolving field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Key things to know</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>This is a remote role</li><br /><li>We want you to start ASAP</li><br /><li>This is a full-time position</li><br /><li>Unlimited vacation days</li><br /><li>Competitive salary</li><br /><li>Stock options</li><br /><li>Premium health insurance</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Working completely from home, you&rsquo;ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and&nbsp;video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15&rdquo; Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us.

Generally, consumer frontends are written in React/ES6, and backends in Typescript (Express for REST APIs and native websockets for RTC). We use Redis as a message broker and Postgres as a persistent datastore. Our infrastructure is (mostly) on AWS.</p><br /><p>The most visually-prominent consumer product is the Koji IDE, a web-based editor that connects to a remote development server and enables full-stack development from any device with a browser. The remote development server uses Docker to create a per-project environment that runs both the editor server (file writes, PTY operations, OT-based real-time collaboration, Git operations, etc.) and the processes/servers required for the user to develop their project (backend servers, frontend dev servers, test runners, etc).</p><br /><p>At a high level, the web editor&rsquo;s frontend uses VSCode&rsquo;s Monaco as a text editor and a custom parser that renders Koji-compliant JSON config files into intuitive visual controls. Because Koji projects are simply modern, standards-compliant Javascript projects (or projects that ultimately target JS), this hybrid approach gives our users the benefits of easy, visual configuration using no-code patterns for manipulating project-level config (strings, colors, styles, mechanics, settings, etc.) without subjecting them to the usual restrictions of no-code/low-code platforms (complex, unintuitive controls; ballooning trees/graphs once projects go beyond simple basics; no ability to drop down and edit native code; etc.).</p><br /><p>Because Koji projects are staged in the cloud during development, the web editor&rsquo;s live preview can be opened on any internet-connected device (without the need for ngrok, mobile device proxies, etc.). The editor provides some additional tools for easily testing backend routes and manipulating PTYs.</p><br /><p>Koji projects are backend by Git repositories. By default, new projects use a Git remote hosted by Koji&rsquo;s Git server, but projects can also use repositories hosted by third-parties as their remotes. The Koji deploy pipeline uses Git hooks to trigger new builds (build steps are defined by a JSON file within the project) and shows build progress, logs, and notifications inside the web editor. Projects can deploy static bundles or dynamic services that are compiled, containerized, and deployed using Google&rsquo;s Cloud Run.</p><br /><p>Once a project is deployed, it can be accessed by an auto-generated subdomain. From within the editor, users can also register a custom subdomain on one of our root domains (e.g., myproject.withkoji.com), or register a custom domain name and configure DNS to point that domain to our CDN. We take care of HTTPS provisioning, deployment, and renewal automatically with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, and all projects are accelerated with our CDN partner, Fastly.</p><br /><p>The CDN that serves deployed projects can also inject plugins at runtime based on path/pattern matching, which lets users easily enable features like Open Graph tags (something that is typically difficult to do on client-side SPAs without SSR or services like Prerender) or integrate things like Google Analytics. The web editor also renders server access logs for deployed projects, giving users an easy way to understand traffic and growth without the need for any third-party analytics/tracking tools.</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p>We are looking for a senior engineer who enjoys shipping products, understanding and designing systems at a high level, and anticipating future challenges while designing and operating within near-term constraints.</p><br /><p>Low-level specialization is a less important consideration for this role. Our ideal candidate is someone with a big appetite, who enjoys exploring and processing big ideas with far-reaching considerations, and who has the drive and ambition to execute on solutions to those problems with an appropriate attention to detail and love of craft. We are a small team, and we are looking for someone we can trust to make big decisions, shape the direction of their role, and ultimately shape the direction of the platform.</p><br /><p>Visit our company page to find a high level overview of our current technical architecture. Experience/familiarity with the technologies we are using is a plus, but is secondary to the more general sensibilities and experience that define the requirements of this role.</p><br /><p>If this description sounds like a fit in any form, and the vision of the platform appeals to you, let&rsquo;s get to know each other.</p>	Sun, 22 Mar 2020 19:45:16 Z	2020-03-22T19:45:16Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	San Diego, CA

(London, UK)	<p>We're looking for senior software engineers to continue developing and scaling our products and infrastructure. We mainly use Go, but you don't need to have used this previously to succeed here.</p><br /><p><em><strong>The Project: </strong></em></p><br /><p>Named by the <strong>World Economic Forum as one of the world's 30 Technology Pioneers 2016</strong>, and one of <strong>Gartner's 'Cool Vendors in Life Sciences' 2018</strong>, Synthace is completely revolutionising biology in a way that has never been done before!</p><br /><p>This is made possible through our revolutionary cloud based platform for designing biological experiments, simulating them, translating instructions for automated lab equipment, and visualising complex data sets from the results. All of this is done by Antha, which is already impacting how scientists work with biology in major companies like Microsoft, BASF, Merck and GSK.</p><br /><p>Antha lowers the level of entry for scientists wanting to introduce automation to their work, while allowing specialist technicians to get even more out of the existing equipment in the labs. It is directly contributing to faster, more efficient research into hard to cure diseases such as Cancer.</p><br /><p><strong>If social impact is important to you, it doesn't get much better than this.</strong></p><br /><p><em><strong>The team and the role:</strong></em></p><br /><p>You'll be working within a tight-knit, friendly and collaborative development team on exciting projects with plenty of technical challenges to get your teeth into.</p><br /><p>You won't find any micro-management here - we're all about trust, enablement and personal ownership. We give you space and autonomy to solve complex problems, while offering support if/when needed.</p><br /><p>We have a <strong>clear company vision</strong>, and we're building a strategy and roadmap to go around this.

We&rsquo;re hiring an Associate Director, Product Infrastructure Engineering to join our Engineering team in our New York City office.</p><br /><p>Oscar is a technology-driven, consumer-focused health insurance startup founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City. Our goal is to make health insurance simple, transparent, and human. We need your help to do so.</p><br /><p><strong>About this role:</strong></p><br /><p>Oscar engineers work on some of the most challenging problems in tech &mdash; helping users navigate the complex health industry through beautiful user applications, elegant distributed system design, making sense of noisy data, statistical learning, and language theory.

Understand the aspirations of your teammates and help them to take on more responsibility for the work they are most passionate about.</li><br /><li>Team execution. You are ultimately responsible for the overall performance of your team, which can be minimally defined as &ldquo;ensuring the right objectives for the team are established, and that they are met at the right time&rdquo;. But we&rsquo;d really like you to help your team knock it out of the park.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>You won&rsquo;t be on your own. Engineering management is a critical and complex role that we take very seriously at Oscar and we support each other to do it well.</p><br /><p><strong>About You:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have 7+ years of software engineering experience, including prior management experience.</li><br /><li>Strong backend engineering experience, preferably with Python</li><br /><li>You make the people and teams around you better through mentorship, collaboration, and guiding developers towards best practices.</li><br /><li>You believe that team performance is even more important than individual performance, and have a track record of leading and managing high-functioning teams.</li><br /><li>You understand the &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; part of Diversity &amp; Inclusion and can help us improve and maintain a great culture where the best ideas prevail.</li><br /></ul>	Wed, 18 Mar 2020 18:06:04 Z	2020-03-18T18:06:04Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	New York, NY

Do animations, interactions, and user experiences delight you? Are you disciplined enough to work in sprints, but also mature enough to work independently?</p><br /><p>Undefined LLC is hiring a full-time&nbsp;React / Node developer to work on customer-facing and internal websites and web applications. Say goodbye to the agency or freelance rat race - you&rsquo;ll be working exclusively on a small number of company-led projects and initiatives.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Projects</strong></p><br /><p>So what types of projects will you be working on?</p><br /><ul><br /><li>A custom e-commerce site built in React and Next, powered on the back-end by Firebase and WordPress</li><br /><li>A custom admin dashboard for a native app with more than 250,000 user accounts and 5,000 daily users, built in React and Next, and powered by Firebase</li><br /><li>A shopify e-commerce site with a custom theme built on Shopify&rsquo;s themekit and React</li><br /><li>An app microsite built in React and Next, powered by Firebase</li><br /><li>Various landing pages and microsites generally built in React and Next, powered by Firebase and/or WordPress as a CMS</li><br /><li>Internal reporting and communication tools that may need some FED love</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>The Daily Grind</strong></p><br /><p>What&rsquo;s a typical day for an Undefined developer? We work in sprints; so, you&rsquo;ll be in daily communication with your dev team members and leadership. But we also work like animals; so, you&rsquo;ll be free to focus on getting your work done. Your week will begin with a Sprint Planning Meeting, you&rsquo;ll have daily stand-ups during the week, and it will end on Friday with a Sprint Review.</p><br /><p>Though most of your time during the week will be working on tasks and bugs, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to step up regularly (if that&rsquo;s your thing) and be involved in higher-level design and direction decisions. We say &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s your thing&rdquo; because some people love that, others don&rsquo;t. And we want you focused mostly on what you love.</p><br /><p><strong>But What Am I Really Doing?</strong></p><br /><p>Sometimes, you&rsquo;ll have an entire Sketch design and you&rsquo;ll be building out the FED. Other times, you&rsquo;ll have the basic design requirements (fonts, colors, etc) and some functionality requirements (credit card form, shipping address), and you&rsquo;ll design and build the page or component in browser. Or maybe you're writing a script to traverse Firestore to pull some data.</p><br /><p>Hey - we just added some new functionality to how subscriptions are set up or we&rsquo;re building out the functionality to export customer lists from our admin portal. You&rsquo;ll FED those components, and also bug fix them should something break or not work as expected.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Tech Stack</strong></p><br /><p>You must know React and Firebase. We use React heavily in our front end development. You must also be great - not good, great - with CSS, SCSS, or some similar styling. We currently use SCSS modules in React, so you should be comfortable with SCSS even if you want to convince us that something better exists.</p><br /><p>You must also have a great - not good, great - eye for CSS animations, timings, transitions...everything animated in the browser. If we (or you) get a crazy idea to animate a user interaction or drop in a little delighter, you&rsquo;ll be the one to pull it off.</p><br /><p>Experience with WordPress and/or Shopify is a plus.</p><br /><p><strong>What You Need To Qualify</strong></p><br /><p>This is a full-time position or contract-to-hire position depending on your situation and needs. To qualify:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Must be a US citizen or resident alien</li><br /><li>Proven work experience as a FED with React</li><br /><li>Proficiency working in git and terminal</li><br /><li>A portfolio and/or repo of actual work experience</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><br /><p>Send us your details - we need to see your work and resume or similar doc. We&rsquo;ll reach out to qualified candidates via email to ask some questions or for a phone conversation.</p>	Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:17:57 Z	2020-03-10T20:17:57Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	Louisville, KY

Working in small, self-managed teams, you&rsquo;ll guide our clients towards creating and automating their cloud infrastructure. We are a vendor-agnostic company, meaning that you will get to apply a diverse mix of tools and services. You mostly perform work from our offices. However, sometimes cooperation with our customers requires us to travel as part of the job.</p><br /><p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong> Our biggest benefits are our people and our culture. We offer a diverse work environment where people are respected for who they are and a culture based on learning, trust, and collaboration. Our Montreal office is conveniently located in the city, specifically in Spaces building. You can also count on:</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Budget and time for learning, personal development, certifications, and contributing to open-source projects</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>A competitive salary (aligned with your experience)</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Unlimited books budget</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Permanent work contracts immediately</p><br /><p><strong>What does it take?</strong></p><br /><p>We often build tailored, innovative solutions within complex and ambiguous environments. Therefore, having an inquisitive mind and the eagerness to explore is vital. On top of that, consulting with clients, which depends on asking the right questions and crafting solutions as a team, requires strong collaboration and communication skills.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Must-have technical skills</strong></p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Background in development and/or operations</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>An understanding of best practices and patterns in software development&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Experience with CI/CD (knowledge of the principles and ability to set up a pipeline from scratch)&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Infrastructure provisioning (such as Terraform, Ansible, Cloud Formation, etc)</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Experience in either public or private cloud</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Understanding and exposure to Kubernetes</p><br /><p><strong>Nice-to-have</strong></p><br /><p>We offer engineering roles at different levels of seniority. These are some attributes that could make you a candidate for more senior positions:</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>A deep and demonstrated understanding of distributed systems, including containerised microservices and highly scalable web applications</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>Advanced (admin-level) knowledge of Kubernetes in production</p><br /><p><strong> </strong>A passion for the community (attending events, advocating cloud technology via meet-ups and conferences, or writing blog posts and other pieces of content)</p><br /><p><strong>How to apply</strong></p><br /><p>Drop us your CV and tell us, briefly, why you are applying.

As part of the BaaS team (or tribe), you'll be expected to lay down the foundation of a highly secure, robust platform and related processes to ensure our software runs smoothly in production as well as making sure it complies with industry standards.</p><br /><p><br><strong>Meet the job</strong><br>The Backbase as a Service tribe is continuously busy with improving their product with the motto ""You build it, you run it"". Striving to have the highest possible uptime, great performance and best in class levels of security. That's quite an ambition and you can't get there without an automation first approach. We pride ourselves on the fact that we don't do manual changes in production and that we automatically validate our environment before deploying. Exactly the same thing should be the case for security, we're not only looking at use cases but also abuse cases. Automated ways of trying to break the system in order to increase security and resiliency.</p><br /><p>As a Principal Cloud Security Engineer, you design things but you also build them. You're part of the development team and will help lift the product to the next level. Focusing on preventing security issues before they go live but when you find something you don't mind creating a pull request to fix the issue rather than put it on some backlog where it never gets looked at anymore. Instead of taking on all security-related activities you coach the team to become more aware of all security-related aspects and when needed you chip in on other stories on the backlog as well.</p><br /><p>Your development path within Backbase will allow you to grow from the function of Principal Cloud Security Engineer to a function as Cloud Security Architect in which you will help multiple teams improve their security competence. By coaching teams, you'll be able to do your work at a larger scale throughout the Backbase organization improving the overall security of our product.</p><br /><p><br><strong>How about you</strong><br> You have a background in programming, preferably in Java;<br> You are proficient in validating and configuring Linux machines;<br> You don't want to just report the security problems but you want to fix them;<br> You are experienced with Cloud environments and desired state configuration;<br> Containerised workloads have no secrets for you;<br> You have experience working in a SOC2 or ISO27001 compliant environment and preferably in setting up or maintaining the process around this;<br> You perform vulnerability testing, risk analysis and security assessments;<br> You analyse security alerts, improve detection capabilities and mitigation capabilities;<br> You define and support secure continuous delivery approaches including tooling, automated testing and threat modelling;<br> You have strong technical knowledge of Secure Engineering principles;<br> You have 3 years of experience in a similar role, Cloud Security Certifications are strongly preferred.</p>"	Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:49:09 Z	2020-03-26T14:49:09Z	http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/	Amsterdam, Netherlands
